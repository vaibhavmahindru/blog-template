# Bloging Website Template

This is a basic template for a blogging website, you just have to connect your databse to it.
I have used a dummy database for this. For the projects section, I have mentioned some of my projects.

To run this build locally run the following commands:

1. git clone https://github.com/vaibhavmahindru/blog-template.git
2. cd meme-generator
3. npm install
4. npm start

As you can see I haven't added any license to it, you can do whatever you want just give credits. ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚
